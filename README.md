Eye Ball Movement Project is created with the identification eye ball based on cursor movement.
In JavaScript, events are actions that happen on a web page. They can be anything
from a mouse moving to a user typing in some text. Events happen to most elements
on the DOM.

Mouse events are a popular way to bind the DOM elements to events. Some of
these events are as follows:
 click: Triggered when the mouse is clicked
 mousemove: Triggered when the mouse moves over an element
 mouseleave: Triggered when mouse the leaves an element

mouse position on the screen using the mouse events.
